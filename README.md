#Before you start, make sure you have download the Neo4j on your desktop, the database version must under 5.0
1. Use maven running the java file
2. You can running the mave either use eclipse (supported) or by command line, check the maven environment is setup before use it
3. When the server is start on port. You can use any tool catch the localhost link. My personal suggest use postman to send the PUT and GET request

 # All set, you can add many people as you want, and use the relationship to connect them. In the database browser you will see a dynamic graph.
